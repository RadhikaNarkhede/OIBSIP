                                <p>Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha) Bojaxhiu—Anjezë is a cognate of "Agnes";
                                    Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower" in Albanian. She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian 
                                    family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia).She was baptised in Skopje the day after
                                    her birth.She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".She was the youngest
                                    child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics 
                                    in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, 
                                    his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania).Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.
